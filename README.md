# Automated Computer Setup

Everything I collect about setting up computers automatically.

Collected files can be found within the "Source" directory.

This collection contains: 
  - [x] Windows 10 Pro unattendet.txt's for BIOS and UEFI which you can place in the root directory of an USB stick created by the media creator to do an automated unattended install of win 10 Pro
